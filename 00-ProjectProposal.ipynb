    "Player physical attributes, particularly height, have long played a central role in how basketball players are evaluated and used at the professional level. In the NBA, height strongly influences positional assignment and on-court responsibilities. Taller players are more likely to occupy interior positions such as center or power forward, where responsibilities emphasize rebounding, rim protection, and screening rather than high-volume scoring. Shorter players, especially guards, are typically more involved in ball handling and shot creation. Because of this specialization, height may be indirectly related to scoring output through role differences rather than scoring ability alone. This is further proven by the fact that players in the top height/weight category with low experience were mostly categorized by \"two-point field goals\", \"offensive and defensive rebounds\", \"blocks\", and \"fouls\".<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1)\n",
    "\n",
    "Prior basketball analytics research has shown that scoring output varies substantially by position, which is closely correlated with height. Analyses of NBA data indicate that guards and wings tend to score more points per minute than forwards and centers due to higher usage rates and greater involvement in offensive actions. While the modern NBA has become more positionless, height still affects how players are used offensively, with taller players generally contributing less to scoring volume and more to non-scoring tasks. As stated in the Southwest Journal, \"height remains a factor, but not the only one dictating a player's role\".<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2)\n",
    "\n",
    "Academic research has also examined the relationship between player anthropometrics and performance statistics. NBA player height and weight in relation to box score metrics and found that height was strongly associated with rebounding and shot blocking, but had a weaker and often negative relationship with scoring when controlling for playing time.<a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3)\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern basketball analytics frequently normalize scoring by playing time using metrics such as points per 36 minutes to allow fair comparisons across players with different minute allocations. NBA statistical documentation recommends per-minute or per-possession metrics when evaluating player production.<a name=\"cite_ref-4\"></a>[<sup>4</sup>](#cite_note-4) Community-driven analytics projects using publicly available NBA data have applied regression models to examine how physical attributes relate to scoring and often find that variables such as usage rate and offensive role explain much more variance than height alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project builds on prior work by focusing specifically on the relationship between player height and points scored per 36 minutes during a single modern NBA season. By treating height as a continuous variable and measuring both statistical significance and variance explained, this analysis aims to determine whether height has a meaningful independent effect on scoring rate or whether its impact is small relative to other factors.\n",

   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "We predict that there will be a significant relationship between an NBA player's height and their points scored per 36 minutes. We expect taller players to score slightly fewer points per 36 minutes on average. This is because taller players have different roles such as defending and rebounding which can prevent them from focusing on attacking and scoring. We also predict that height will only have a small impact on the variance in scoring rate.\n",
